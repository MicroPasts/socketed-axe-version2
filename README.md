## 3D Model Metadata ##

This is an informal set of metadata for a 3D model produced via the
MicroPasts crowdsourcing web platform (http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org).

### General Information ###

This object is a 'socketed axe' of Late Bronze or Early Iron Age date,
found on the Isle of Wight at Arreton Down. Its blade had been wedged
into the socket, a feature present in a number of axes found
throughout Europe. This has been interpreted as either a way of
keeping the broken axe parts together before being recycled, or a
structured, ritual act which fragmented and transformed the
object. The axe will be cleaned and the blade removed in the near
future, however this model will provide us with a permanent 3 dimensional
record of its condition when found.

### Available Data ###

We have created three models: a textured mesh with 100k faces, another
with 300k faces, and the original dense point cloud. The raw images,
image masks and exported information about camera position and alignment markers are also available.

### Processing and Quality Assessment ###

This model was created in PhotoScan Pro 1.1.6

The photographs used in this model were taken on a tripod, but were not
colour-balanced before modelling.
